        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Hi my name is Richmond Perera my major is New Media Tech-Game Design. The reason I chose this major is because I want to make video games.</p>
        <p>I been playing video games since I was little and still play this day. The evolution of consoles I had were Playstation 1, Playstation 2,Xbox 360 and now currently I have a Xbox one.</p>
        <p>I like basketball and soccer.My favorite basketball team is the Golden State Warriors and my favorite soccer team is Barcelona.</p>
        <p>I am mixed race meaning my dad is from Sri Lanka and my mom is from Dominican Republic who both were immigrants who traveled from their country to get to the United States. Spanish is my second language but I am not fluent but I have decent understanding of Spanish.</p>

        <p>Lastly I am trying to be the first child in my family to complete college. “Find a job you enjoy doing, and you will never have to work a day in your life.”-Mark Twain This quote means alot to me because its basically saying if you find a job you like you work harder because it's something you care about. </p>
